Prototype Validation Statement

The results presented in this prototype are true and accurate outputs generated by the StatelessStatesâ„¢ Financial AI system.

The Training Loss Curve reflects actual model convergence, demonstrating rapid reduction in error and stable optimization.

The True vs Predicted regression plot confirms predictive accuracy, with outputs aligning closely to real test data.

The Financial Data Example (AAPL, 6 months) integrates genuine stock market data, confirming the systemâ€™s ability to process and model real-world financial datasets.


These results verify the functional foundation of the prototype and establish a clear path for scaling to larger datasets, integrating quantum simulations, and extending to advanced financial pricing models.

*Part of the **StatelessStatesâ„¢** R&D initiative into AI + Finance + Quantum intersections.*
